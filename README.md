# Description 

I created this app as part of my Mobile Software Development course. Using Swift, I created a basic app allowing users to peruse a list of available books (generated by a 
mock api that I substantiated with books I've read - most science fiction and fantasy!). The app is designed somewhat in the vein of an e-reader or library app, except that
this is meant only for user edification and tracking purposes, rather than for conducting transactions. 

With swipe gestures, users are able to add/remove them to either a To-Read or 
Completed Shelf, write short reviews, and mark selections as favorites. The To-Read and Completed selections are available on additional tabs. On the home page, there is 
also a sort button that allows users to organize books alphabetically, as well as a search bar enabling users to filter the selection of books by inputting text. 
I used Core Data functionality so that user selections persist across tab switches and the closing/reopening of the app.
